# Physarum 2D

## Overview
This is an implementation of a generative algorithm designed to mimic the behavior of the Physarum Polycephalum slime mold.
The algorithm is described by Jeff Jones in his paper, ["Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks."](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) The program is written in c++ and uses OpenGL to run compute shaders and display the final image. The library ImGui is used to add a GUI to program so that parameters can be changed while running.

# Examples


# Running
This program can be run using visual studio by opening the solution file. Mac and Linux are not supported.

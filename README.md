# Physarum 2D

## Overview
This is an implementation of a generative algorithm designed to mimic the behavior of the Physarum Polycephalum slime mold.
The algorithm is described by Jeff Jones in his paper [Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579)
